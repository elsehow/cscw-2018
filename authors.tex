\begin{abstract}
Virtual reality typically seeks to immerse an isolated user in a virtual environment to achieve a sense of virtual presence while diminishing awareness of social and physical surroundings. This pictorial inverts this to explore design opportunities afforded by intentionally diminished virtual presence. Through playful misuse of the HTC Vive VR system, we outline tactics such as “interrupting” a VR user’s virtual presence with social interaction, physical contact, or physical artifacts, and sharing the Vive controllers across multiple users. We invite designers to rethink assumptions about virtual presence, suggesting opportunities for more collocated social and physically situated interactions with VR.
